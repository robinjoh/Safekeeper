Work in progress. 

The application is in the end meant to work as a reminder app. You can track Estimote nearables and get notifications when your phone is out of range of the nearable. A typical use case would be to track the nearable in the app and place the nearable in your wallet. In that way you would receive a notification if you forget your wallet somewhere.
